# SpringProject

I used bootstrap and thymeleaf to create the front end.

PostgreSQL as a database

I configure security with Spring Security, custom annotations, thymeleaf extras, spring sessions, webmvc and mail to manage the cookies with v3 Google Captcha.

Tests with junit and mockito

Utilities: Lombock

As my first web project Its going to be a simple crud app focused the basics more than the utilities.
